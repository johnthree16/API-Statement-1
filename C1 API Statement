This app will allow correspondence between myself and the user, with the main objective being the user's request for my professional services.
The user will be afforded the oppurtunity to see my photograph, as to enhance the human aspect of a profession that by and large
does it's dealings via back and forth communication over a multitude of electronic devices, rather than in person.
The app will provide an icon style link to my Linkedin page which has purposefully been placed in the header for ease of access upon arrival.
The app will provide a detailed overview of the skills I offer my clients, or any company that may be interested in correspondence.
The app will then allow the user the ability to complete a form that includes a request of their name, email address as well
as a 1000 character limit text box to describe in detail how I may be of assistance to them, or the company that they represent.
After completing a reCAPTCHA test, submission of their information will be sent to my email.
